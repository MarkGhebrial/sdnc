# About Us

San Diego Nerf Club.

We typically host one or two games per month. Our competitive games are either hosted
in a church gym or at the Huntington Beach Sports Complex. Our casual games typically
happen monthly at Modern Airsoft in Oceanside and semiannually at Jungle Island
Paintball.

You can view our current event schedule [here](/events). For more information about
the club and our events, visit our discord server.

We are most active on our Discord server. You can join by clicking [here](/discord).

We also have a Facebook group, but it's an ancient relic that's no longer active.
