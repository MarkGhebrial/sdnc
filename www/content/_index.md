# About Us

San Diego Nerf Club is a small group of nerf enthusiasts spread throughout Southern 
California. We typically host one or two public nerf games per month.

You can view our current event schedule [here](/events). For more information about
the club and our events, visit our [discord server](/join).

# Venues

Below is a list of the places we host games:
- **Modern Airsoft** is an indoors cqb airsoft arena in Oceanside. We typically play there once
  a month on Thursday evenings. Modern airsoft games have a 160 fps cap.
- **"The Church"** is a Mormon church in Santee whose gym we borrow for small competitive
  games. Church games are either played at 160 fps or 220 fps depending on the game
  mode.
- **Jungle Island Paintball** is an outdoor paintball arena in Lake Elsinore. Jungle
  Island games require full face eye protection due to the venue's insurance policy.
  Jungle Island games have a 220 fps cap.
- **Huntington Beach Sports Complex** has outdoor fields with artificial turf that
  we occasionally rent for larger competitive games. We play at the sports complex
  when practicing for tournaments such as CFT and MFT
